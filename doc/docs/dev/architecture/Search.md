# Search
Search in TDM is based off of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). Initial search using ArangoDB was effective, but extremely latent and resource intensive. Some broad terms resulted in ~60GB memory usage and took nearly a minute to return. In contrast, Elasticsearch returns in fractions of a second and holds at a steady ~1-2GB memory usage.

Elasticsearch is *not* a source-of-truth for TDM. Elasticsearch should always be thought of as a cache of data which could potentially be out-of-sync with the ArangoDB instance of TDM which all other operations use. Elasticsearch is very-specifically a point solution to the original searchability issues.

## Indexing
The index for Elasticsearch defines the schema of documents and how inputs should be processed and analyzed. The index was derived from:
* [Example Python](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/blob/master/example/load.py#L17)
* [Analysis Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html)
* [Custom Analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-custom-analyzer.html)
* [Simple Pattern Split Tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-simplepatternsplit-tokenizer.html)
* [Snowball Token Filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-snowball-tokenfilter.html)
* [Unique Token Filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-unique-tokenfilter.html)

This index specifies a custom analyzer and provides the `machine_id` and `human_id` of the DataPaths as fulltext search and as terms for aggregation.

Loading of the data takes every permutation of a DataPath and its OS/Releases and creates a new document per permutation. This is not necessarily the *best* way to go about loading the data, but it was the clearest path forward. This does mean that there is a significant duplication albeit unique/qualified in document. If you are familiar with Elasticsearch and have recommendations, please [contact us](/Contact.html).

## Query
The Elasticsearch query in its current form performs an aggregation on the DataPath `human_id`. The results are ordered according to relevancy per the scoring of the query. An example query form is presented below.

```json
{
    "size": 0,
    "sort": [
        "_score"
    ],
    "query": {
        "bool": {

                        "query": "openconfig interface name",
                        "operator": "and",
                        "type": "most_fields",
                        "fields": [
                            "dp_human_id^3",

### ArangoDB Query
ArangoDB has some fulltext capabilities that we initially utilized. The query template is below. This query is wildly inefficient, but was the only one to provide a consistent upper-bound time window of return that was acceptable for usage.

```
