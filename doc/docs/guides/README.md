## [Identifying and Validating Mappings](Identifying%20and%20Validating%20Mappings.md)
Identifying and validating the mappings between Data Paths can be the most frustrating part of using and contributing to TDM. Unfortunately this process is not always easy nor are there tools to do it automatically. This document will walk through the usage of TDM and relevant tooling to identify relevant Data Paths, and how to validate whether Data Paths which appear similar may be considered enough of a match to map in TDM.
